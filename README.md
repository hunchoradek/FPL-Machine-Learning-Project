# FPL-Machine-Learning-Project

A simple tool for predicting the top players for the next gameweek of FPL. For this example the tool is predicting the best players to use for gameweek 12 of the 2024/25 Premier League season.
Very barebones, lacks some features and style.

Tool created for my uni classes (Deep Learning in Theory and Applications)

The data for this project are from this repository: https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League
